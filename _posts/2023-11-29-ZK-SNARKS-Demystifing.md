Get basic knowledge about zero-knowledge proofs, which are a way to prove a statement is true without revealing anything beyond the truthiness of the statement.

As described abose, ZKPs are a way to prove a statement is true without revealing anything beyond the truthiness of the statement. It means like "I could prove you that know the fact without tell you a fact".

- I know value `X` such that `SHA256(x) = 0x7ace...` but don't tell you `X`.
- I know how to fill a map with 3 colors such that every 2 adjacent regions are different color.
