Here are our challenge writeups from the CryptoCTF 2020 competition. Members of the CryptoHack community played under the team "CryptoHackers" and came second overall, solving 18 of the 20 challenges during the 24 hour competition. This was the first time we all played a CTF together, and we will definitely be doing it again in the future. It was truly a pleasure to get so many cryptographic brains together in one chatroom and collaborate on cracking some mindbending puzzles.

Thank you to everyone who played for the CryptoHackers, and to ASIS CTF for organising this enjoyable event. Congratulations to hellmann for being an astonishingly quick one man army!
