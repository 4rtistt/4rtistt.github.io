We're really excited to be sharing a new set of challenges with you all, with puzzles contributed from CryptoHack as well as the community. One of our motivations for CryptoHack was to create an excuse to learn as much as we could, and we love having the opportunity to play your puzzles and learn new areas of maths and cryptography.

Recently we've been playing the Ledger Donjon CTF [Capture the Fortress](https://donjon-ctf.io) as the team CryptoHackers. This is our second group competition we've played, after CryptoCTF back in August ([Write Ups](https://blog.cryptohack.org/cryptoctf2020)). There's still a week left in the competition and we're working hard for that number one spot.

We also recently added a new [careers](https://cryptohack.org/careers/) feature to CryptoHack which we hope will be another way we can support our community. Companies are able to include job opportunities onto the site and we hope that this can be a resource for cryptographers to get an understanding of how they can work with cryptography day-to-day. If you are interested in using the careers feature to reach CryptoHack players, then please visit our [FAQ](https://cryptohack.org/faq/#morequestions) for more information.

Lastly, we want to say thank you to everyone who has started supporting CryptoHack using [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cryptohack). We are very grateful and are putting this money into paying for server costs and looking forward to introducing new features to the site.

- **Jack's Birthday Hash** To celebrate his birthday, Jack has developed a brand new hashing algorithm but needs you to help him look into just how cryptographically secure it is. This pair of puzzles will be developed into a series about the fundamentals of hashing soon.
